# Automating Readtheory using Python in conjunction with Selenium (OSX)

Trust me guys, it's not as boring as it sounds. Here's to hoping that I don't lose anyone in the following section because this is my first writeup of any kind :)

## why u do dis??

Well, my English teacher assigned our class to do 50+ Readtheory quizzes if we wanted the highest grade possible. She said that she didn't really care too much about the answers being correct (and even said so herself that it was "a numbers game") so I took it upon myself to reach that goal in the laziest way possible. What was supposed to be a quick and easy coding session (with minimal effort involved) turned into a unexpectedly fun and frustrating coding project. 

## john lenin, pls help for i do not know what i need
Sure. You're going to need to install the following dependencies. I'm going to link the instructions, but feel free to contact me if you've got any questions.
* Python
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). You'll need this to install everything else
* Chromedriver and Chrome Canary. Code to install it with brew is as is (using terminal): ```brew install chromedriver && brew install Caskroom/versions/google-chrome-canary```
* Selenium for Python. You can install it using `sudo pip selenium`. If you don't have `pip` then follow the [instructions here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/how-do-i-install-pip-on-macos-or-os-x/18947390#18947390)
